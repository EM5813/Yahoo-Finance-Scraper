# Yahoo-Finance-Scraper
 A webscraper to extract historical stock and other meta data from Yahoo! Finance

The example below is pulling 5 years of daily stock data for Ford Motor Company. I'm replicating the API request made by the Yahoo! Finance website, so you can adjust the Range and Interval parameters based on what's allowed... you can see what's allowed on the website... or you'll get some hints returned if you submit a bad api request.
